XtendApp
========

A skeleton Xtend app with gradle and Android Studio integration, and the Xtendroid (https://github.com/tobykurien/Xtendroid) library.

The actionbar has been replaced by the app bar (v21), [following these instructions.](http://antonioleiva.com/material-design-everywhere/)

Mind: you have to do your own lollipop activity transition.
